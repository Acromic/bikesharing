## Purpose

Bike-sharing trip analysis. To show how profitable the bike-sharing program could be in Des Moines.
For this analysis, I used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, created a set of visualizations in Tableau to:

  *Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
  *Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
  *Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Technologies

  *Python
  *Pandas
  *Tableau
  *CSV

## Results
* Graph shows the top start locations <br>

## Summary <br>
The data shows the bike-sharing program to be a solid business. True peaks times show exercise and commute to play a factore in the success of the
bike-sharing program. With early times peaking at 8am and evening times peaking at 5pm and 6pm. Gender showing that is more popular amongst males.
With more advertising and finding further ways to show interest, the future looks like a good investment.
